### Why

Many great ideas don't meet the world because publishing them is still too hard.
You either need to put in huge effort to set up a blog on your own, or write on
commercial platforms that try their best to lock you in. We believe you, and
your ideas, deserve better.

With Memos.pub, you can just write. We will do the rest to get you a blog. You
don't need to sign up, or configure, or give us your content. In fact, you don't
need to do a thing. We use what you already have in public, and professionally
present them for you. You already have a blog.
